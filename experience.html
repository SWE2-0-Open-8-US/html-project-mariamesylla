            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>As an IT specialist at a public school, I had the opportunity to work in a dynamic environment where I played a crucial role in supporting the school's 
                technical infrastructure. My responsibilities included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Providing technical support to students, teachers, and staff.

                </li>
                <li>Performing system maintenance and troubleshooting hardware 
                    and software issues.
                </li>
                <li>Managing and maintaining the school's computer
                     systems and networks.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>My experience in this role allowed me to develop
                 strong problem-solving skills and a solid foundation in IT, 
                 which I'm eager to apply to my future endeavors as a junior 
                 engineer.
