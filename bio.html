        <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm [Your Name]. I previously worked as an IT specialist at a public school, where I gained hands-on experience in troubleshooting, maintaining computer systems, and providing technical 
        support to students and staff. My time in the field has shaped my passion for technology and problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>Currently, I'm on the path to completing my associate degree in Computer
         Science, and I'm excited to transition into a junior engineering role. 
         I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skills to contribute to
          meaningful projects in the world of technology.
